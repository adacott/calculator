https://adacott.github.io/odin-calculator/ -- Live project pages link to see the calculator in action

This is the final part of the odin project fundamentals course for javascript, html, and css. This project demonstrates extreme familiarity and intermediate to
advanced use of HTML, CSS, and javscript to create a fully-working calculator that supports the basic mathematical operations in a (mostly) bug-free and 
clean user experience.
